To run this test type:
../test_dbpp > test_dbpp.new

Note this will cause a harmless warning to be written to stderr:
DatascopeHandle destructor (WARNING):  closing a database with other copies holding view pointers
This can cause mysterious downstream problems and/or memory leaksCheck your code.

Ignore this.

then run a diff between test_dbpp.out and test_dbpp.new

You will want to check the testout.site and compare it to testdb.site.
They should be identical except for lddate.
