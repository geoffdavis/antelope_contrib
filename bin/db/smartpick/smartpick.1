.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsmartpick\fP program allows control of the dbpick(1) application
through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) window. When all features are
exercised, \fBsmartpick\fP can be seen as a framework for users to
build their own customized dbpick(1) command GUI. The current version
of \fBsmartpick\fP is a complete rewrite of the original, which has
been preserved under the name \fBsmartpick_classic\fP.

The \fBsmartpick\fP program has a number of the most common dbpick
options directly on its command line. It is intended to launch dbpick
immediately upon its own startup, or after the fact via a GUI button.
(Additional, less-common options for dbpick(1) may be specified in the
\fIdbpick_options\fP parameter of the \fBsmartpick\fP parameter file).

Many things are configurable with \fBsmartpick\fP that were not
with the earlier smartpick(1) program. All of the relevant window
sizes and locations can be configured via the parameter file.  You
can make the dbpick waveforms window exactly as big as you want and
control where it goes at startup with the \fIdbpick_geometry\fP
parameter (this and all other geometry specifications are formatted
as described in the X(7) man page under GEOMETRY SPECIFICATIONS,
e.g. WIDTHxHEIGHT+XOFFSET+YOFFSET with all four values specified as 
integer numbers of pixels; also see the examples below).  You can
make the dbpick commands window exactly as big as you want, control
whether it starts up iconified, and control where it goes at startup
with the two parameters \fIdbpick_command_geometry\fP and
\fIdbpick_command_iconified\fP.  You can control where the
\fBsmartpick\fP GUI itself goes at startup with the
\fIsmartpick_geometry\fP parameter.

You can control what buttons are included on your instance of
\fBsmartpick\fP, and you can control their layout, all through the
parameter file. This is accomplished via the Antelope ptkform(3p)
utility. In addition to adding and arranging the buttons of interest,
ptkform(3p) \fIframe\fP widgets can be used to organize them as
desired. Of course, you have to learn a couple things about the
grid-layout mechanism that Tk::grid(3) and ptkform(3p) use. However, in
the end the modifications to the parameter file are fairly simple and
involve merely putting the buttons, entryboxes and other widgets you
want to include into rows and columns as you wish. (Hint: In the
\fIlayout\fP table of the parameter file, look for the row,column
numbers for the widgets you're interested in moving, and experiment
with changing their locations, or with erasing the rows for the buttons
you don't want or need.)

All buttons have balloon help, though these balloons can be turned off
by setting the \fIballoon_help\fP parameter to a false value, or by
toggling the \fIBalloon Help\fP setting in the \fIOptions\fP menu of
the menubar.

A control-C in the \fBsmartpick\fP window kills the application (as
does File->Quit).

Screen-snapshots of the dbpick screen may be made with the File->Snapshot
menu item if the ImageMagick import(1) command is installed and 
available. Dbpick postscript output may be created with the File->Postscript 
menu item, or piped to a unix command with the File->Pipe_postscript menu
item (this can be useful, for example, if you have the ps2pdf(1) 
utility installed on your system, e.g. specify \fIps2pdf - myfile.pdf\fP). 
The File->Print menu item sends the dbpick postscript output to the 
command specified as \fIprint_command\fP in the parameter file (usually 
the Unix \fIlp\fP command). 

The File menu also contains the commands \fIOpen Arrivals Db\fP, 
\fIOpen Events Db\fP, and \fIOpen Detections Db\fP, which open secondary
databases in dbpick(1) with the dbpick(1) commands \fIoa\fP, \fIoe\fP, 
and \fIod\fP, respectively. 

.SS widget bindings

The following section describes the details of the \fBsmartpick\fP
graphical layout tools. If you are content with the layout and
performance of the \fBsmartpick\fP GUI as-is, you can ignore this
section.

Widgets with the following names specified in the \fIlayout\fP table of
the parameter file invoke subroutines that perform the specified tasks.
Note that these must be the exact names of the widgets as given to the
ptkform(3p) utility (i.e. the second item on each row in the
\fIlayout\fP table). The actual displayed text of the buttons (fifth
item on each line of the \fIlayout\fP table) may be changed as
desired.

.SS widget bindings -- buttons

.IP ae
Find an event that associates with the current arrivals.  This is
equivalent to the \fIae\fP command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP "dbxcor_.*"
A variety of different buttons can be constructed for individual phases, 
each of which will trigger dbxcor processing for the specified phase and
the current origin in dbpick. An alternative to these buttons is the 
\fIdbxcor\fP optionmenu, which is described in more detail below. 

.IP dw
This button deletes channels with no waveforms in the display.
This is equivalent to the \fIdw\fP command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP exec_spgram
This button launches the dbspgram(1) program on the single station-channel
segment of waveform data displayed in dbpick(1).

.IP fa
This button time-scrolls the display in dbpick(1) to the first phase
arrival with an existing waveform. This is equivalent to the \fIfa\fP
command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP Fe
Find an event with associations to the current arrivals.  This is
equivalent to the \fIFe\fP command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP fe
This button time-scrolls the display in dbpick(1) to the first event
in the origin table. This is equivalent to the \fIfe\fP
command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP "first_.*"
A variety of different buttons can be constructed based on the
tables of dbprocess(3) expressions in the \fIdbprocess_special\fP 
array in the parameter file (see below). For example, you can create a 
quartet of buttons \fIfirst_teleseism\fP, \fInext_teleseism\fP, 
\fIprevious_teleseism\fP, \fIlast_teleseism\fP that will step through 
the origins in a view formed by the \fIdbprocess_special{teleseism}\fP
array entry. The last part of the button name (after the prefix \fIfirst_\fP)
must exactly match a key in the \fIdbprocess_special\fP array of the 
parameter file.

.IP fw
This button time-scrolls the display in dbpick(1) to the first existing
waveform. This is equivalent to the \fIfw\fP command in the dbpick(1)
command window.

.IP "group_.*"
A variety of different buttons can be constructed based on the
station-group names listed in the \fIgroups\fP table of the parameter
file. Each button name should begin with the string \fIgroup_\fP. The
button name should end with a group-name that is identical (including
identical capitalization) to a key value from the \fIgroups\fP table of
the parameter file. Buttons with names matching this pattern invoke
functions which show the requested group in the dbpick(1) window when
pressed. The channels chosen when invoking one of the groups buttons
depend on the current setting of the \fIchannels\fP option-menu. See
also the \fIgroups_.*\fP widgets below.

.IP kill_dbpick
A button of this name in the ptkform(3p) specification invokes a
subroutine that kills the currently running dbpick(1) program.

.IP "last_.*"
A variety of different buttons can be constructed based on the
tables of dbprocess(3) expressions in the \fIdbprocess_special\fP 
array in the parameter file (see below). For example, you can create a 
quartet of buttons \fIfirst_teleseism\fP, \fInext_teleseism\fP, 
\fIprevious_teleseism\fP, \fIlast_teleseism\fP that will step through 
the origins in a view formed by the \fIdbprocess_special{teleseism}\fP
array entry. The last part of the button name (after the prefix \fIfirst_\fP)
must exactly match a key in the \fIdbprocess_special\fP array of the 
parameter file.

.IP le
This button time-scrolls the display in dbpick(1) to the last event
in the origin table. This is equivalent to the \fIle\fP
command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP na
This button time-scrolls the display in dbpick(1) to the next phase
arrival with an existing waveform. This is equivalent to the \fIna\fP
command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP ne
This button time-scrolls the display in dbpick(1) to the next event
in the origin table. This is equivalent to the \fIne\fP
command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP "next_.*"
A variety of different buttons can be constructed based on the
tables of dbprocess(3) expressions in the \fIdbprocess_special\fP 
array in the parameter file (see below). For example, you can create a 
quartet of buttons \fIfirst_teleseism\fP, \fInext_teleseism\fP, 
\fIprevious_teleseism\fP, \fIlast_teleseism\fP that will step through 
the origins in a view formed by the \fIdbprocess_special{teleseism}\fP
array entry. The last part of the button name (after the prefix \fIfirst_\fP)
must exactly match a key in the \fIdbprocess_special\fP array of the 
parameter file.

.IP nw
This button time-scrolls the display in dbpick(1) to the next existing
waveform. This is equivalent to the \fInw\fP command in the dbpick(1)
command window.

.IP pa
This button time-scrolls the display in dbpick(1) to the previous phase
arrival with an existing waveform. This is equivalent to the \fIpa\fP
command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP pe
This button time-scrolls the display in dbpick(1) to the previous event
in the origin table. This is equivalent to the \fIpe\fP
command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP "previous_.*"
A variety of different buttons can be constructed based on the
tables of dbprocess(3) expressions in the \fIdbprocess_special\fP 
array in the parameter file (see below). For example, you can create a 
quartet of buttons \fIfirst_teleseism\fP, \fInext_teleseism\fP, 
\fIprevious_teleseism\fP, \fIlast_teleseism\fP that will step through 
the origins in a view formed by the \fIdbprocess_special{teleseism}\fP
array entry. The last part of the button name (after the prefix \fIfirst_\fP)
must exactly match a key in the \fIdbprocess_special\fP array of the 
parameter file.

.IP pw
This button time-scrolls the display in dbpick(1) to the previous existing
waveform. This is equivalent to the \fIpw\fP command in the dbpick(1)
command window.

.IP rec
This button arranges stations by increasing distance from the currently
selected origin. This is equivalent to the \fIrec\fP command in the
dbpick(1) command window.

.IP sa_off
This button hides arrival pick flags in dbpick(1). This is equivalent
to the \fIsa off\fP command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP sa_on
This button shows arrival pick flags in dbpick(1). This is equivalent
to the \fIsa on\fP command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP sas_off
This button turns off the coloring of arrival pick flags according to association
status in dbpick(1). This is equivalent to the \fIsas off\fP command in 
the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP sas_on
This button turns on the coloring of arrival pick flags according to association
status in dbpick(1). This is equivalent to the \fIsas on\fP command in 
the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP sd_off
This button hides detection glyphs in dbpick(1). This is equivalent to
the \fIsd off\fP command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP sd_on
This button shows detection glyphs in dbpick(1). This is equivalent to
the \fIsd on\fP command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP sf_off
This button hides first motion glyphs in dbpick(1). This is equivalent
to the \fIsf off\fP command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP sf_on
This button shows first motion glyphs in dbpick(1). This is equivalent
to the \fIsf on\fP command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP sfit
This button fits the trace display in the vertical direction.  This is
equivalent to the \fIsfit\fP command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP soa_off
This button hides overlay arrival pick flags in dbpick(1). This is
equivalent to the \fIsoa off\fP command in the dbpick(1) command
window.

.IP soa_on
This button shows overlay arrival pick flags in dbpick(1). This is
equivalent to the \fIsoa on\fP command in the dbpick(1) command
window.

.IP start_dbe
A button of this name in the ptkform(3p) specification invokes a
subroutine that launches the dbe(1) program on the current
database.

.IP start_dbpick
A button of this name in the ptkform(3p) specification invokes a
subroutine that launches the dbpick(1) program on the current
database.

.IP sw_off
This button turns off waveform plotting in dbpick(1) (i.e. forces
dbpick(1) to plot waveforms as gray bars, for quick navigation and
review of data coverage). This is equivalent to the \fIsw off\fP
command in the dbpick(1) command window. An alternative
approach in \fBsmartpick\fP is to use the \fIsw\fP option menu. 

.IP sw_on
This button turns on waveform plotting in dbpick(1). This is equivalent
to the \fIsw on\fP command in the dbpick(1) command window. An alternative
approach in \fBsmartpick\fP is to use the \fIsw\fP option menu. 

.IP swa
This button shows only waveforms with arrivals.
This is equivalent to the \fIswa\fP command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP swd
This button shows only waveforms with detections.
This is equivalent to the \fIswd\fP command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP swda
This button shows only waveforms with detections or arrivals.
This is equivalent to the \fIswda\fP command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.IP tfit
This button toggles the time-fit mode, which automatically adjusts the
window so that it exactly fits the waveform segments currently
displayed.  This is equivalent to the \fItfit\fP command in the
dbpick(1) command window.

.IP tse
Time scroll to the current event origin time.  This is equivalent to
the \fItse\fP command in the dbpick(1) command window.

.SS widget bindings -- option menus

.IP channels
This is a ptkform(3p) optionmenu which creates a menu of channel
subsets, as specified in the \fIchannels\fP array of the parameter
file. If the special value of \fI<auto>\fP is given in the list of menu
options to display, the menu is filled in using the keys in the
\fIchannels\fP table of the parameter file.

.IP cts
This is a ptkform(3p) optionmenu which executes the dbpick(1) command
\fIcts on\fP or \fIcts off\fP to label waveforms amplitudes in counts
or physical units. The option-menu items which must appear in the
\fBsmartpick\fP parameter-file are \fIPhysical\fP and \fICounts\fP.

.IP dbxcor
This is a ptkform(3p) optionmenu which allows dbxcor(1) to be invoked
for the named phase and the current orid from dbpick(1). The dbpick(1) 
application is queried for the orid number, so dbpick must be running, and 
also it must be already focused on an event. The \fBsmartpick\fP application
assumes that dbxcor(1) has been started independently and is already running
The communication with dbxcor(1) is via the Antelope tksend(1) mechanism,
so smartpick must know the proper Tk application-name of dbxcor(1) (either 
set through the \fBsmartpick\fP command-line option \fIdbxcor_appname\fP, 
or through the \fBsmartpick\fP GUI entry widget \fIdbxcor_appname\fP,
or left at its default value of \fIdbxcor\fP). Note that an alternative 
to this optionmenu is to use the \fIdbxcor_.*\fP buttons (see above) to create
a specific, simple button for each phase of interest. 

.IP default_phase
This is a ptkform(3p) optionmenu which allows the default phase to be set
for picking arrivals. The option chosen is given to the dbpick(1) \fIph\fP
command.

.IP gp
This is a ptkform(3p) optionmenu which executes the dbpick(1) command
\fIgp\fP to set the gap handling.

.IP "groups_.*"
A variety of different optionmenus can be constructed based on the
station-group names listed in the \fIgroups\fP table of the parameter
file. Each optionmenu name should begin with the string \fIgroups_\fP.
The optionmenu name should end with a unique string (e.g. you can only
have one optionmenu called \fIgroups_Alphabetical\fP). The list of
entries given to each of these optionmenus should contain key values
from the parameter-file \fIgroups\fP table. Alternatively, if the
special value of \fI<nettype XX>\fP is given (where the \fIXX\fP should
be replaced with one of the network.nettype values present in the
stations database), the optionmenu is filled with all networks matching
that network.nettype.  These optionmenus invoke functions which show
the requested group in the dbpick(1) window when pressed. The channels
chosen when invoking one of the groups buttons depend on the current
setting of the \fIchannels\fP option-menu. See also the \fIgroup_.*\fP
widgets above. The difference between the \fIgroup_.*\fP widgets and
the \fIgroups_.*\fP widgets is that the former make a button that
always shows the one configured station group, whereas the latter make
an optionmenu that gives you a choice amongst several station groups.

.IP mg
This is a ptkform(3p) optionmenu which executes the dbpick(1) command
\fImg on\fP or \fImg off\fP to label accelerations in milli-Gs or
nm/s/s. The option-menu items which must appear in the \fBsmartpick\fP
parameter-file are \fImilli_g\fP and \fInm_per_sec_2\fP.

.IP np
This is a ptkform(3p) optionmenu which creates a menu of choices for
showing the next occurring phase of the chosen type. The option chosen 
is given to the dbpick(1) \fInp\fP command. Common choices are 
\fIP\fP, \fIS\fP, or any other phase of interest in the database. 

.IP pal
This is a ptkform(3p) optionmenu which executes the dbpick(1) command
\fIpal\fP to set P-align mode. See the dbpick(1) man page for further 
details on P-align mode. The accepted values are \fIon\fP and \fIoff\fP. 

.IP pp
This is a ptkform(3p) optionmenu which creates a menu of choices for
showing the previous occuring phase of the chosen type. The option chosen 
is given to the dbpick(1) \fIpp\fP command. Common choices are 
\fIP\fP, \fIS\fP, or any other phase of interest in the database. 

.IP show_predicted
This is a ptkform(3p) optionmenu which creates a menu of choices for
showing predicted arrivals. The option chosen is given to the dbpick(1)
\fIsp\fP command. Common choices are \fIoff\fP, \fIbasic\fP, and \fIS,P\fP.
Each phase list should be comma-separated and without any entrained spaces.

.IP sw
This is a ptkform(3p) optionmenu which executes the dbpick(1) command
\fIsw\fP to set the waveform display mode. This is equivalent to 
the dbpick(1) \fIsw\fP command. This option menu may have two values, 
\fIShow\fP and \fIHide\fP. The former turns on waveform display by 
executing the dbpick(1) command \fIsw on\fP and the latter turns off 
waveform display (replaces the squiggles with simple, fast-plotting 
gray bars) by executing the dbpick(1) command \fIsw off\fP. An alternative
approach in \fBsmartpick\fP is to use the \fIsw_on\fP and \fIsw_off\fP 
buttons.

.SS widget bindings -- entry boxes

.IP appname
An entry box of this name allows the user to change the TCL/Tk window
name which \fBsmartpick\fP expects dbpick to have. Sometimes, for
example through stopping and starting \fBsmartpick\fP, this can get out
of sync. The unregister(1) or xwininfo(1) command can be used to get
the TCL/Tk window name of the dbpick application. On rare occasions it
might also be useful to use \fBsmartpick\fP to manage multiple
instances of dbpick.

.IP dbxcor_appname
An entry box of this name allows the user to change the TCL/Tk window
name which \fBsmartpick\fP expects dbxcor(1) to have. Sometimes, for
example through stopping and starting \fBsmartpick\fP, this can get out
of sync. The unregister(1) or xwininfo(1) command can be used to get
the TCL/Tk window name of the dbxcor(1) application. On rare occasions it
might also be useful to use \fBsmartpick\fP to manage multiple
instances of dbxcor(1).

.IP cm
An entry box of this name allows the user to set the maximum number 
of traces dbpick(1) will display, via the dbpick(1) \fIcm\fP command. 

.IP cw
An entry box of this name allows the user to choose the waveforms 
to be displayed, given the integer number of the starting trace 
and the integer number of traces to display (these two values should 
be specified in the entry box, separated by spaces). 

.IP dbname
An entry box of this name allows the name of the database to be
changed, for starting and stopping dbpick(1) on various databases.

.IP num_nearby_stations
An entry box of this name controls how many nearby stations are shown 
along with a given station, when a single station is chosen for 
display. The initial value of this widget is set to the value of the 
identically named \fInum_nearby_stations\fP parameter in the 
parameter file. If \fInum_nearby_stations\fP is greater than zero, 
the stations are sorted and displayed in order of ascending distance
from the chosen station. 

.IP orid
An entry box of this name allows the user to specify the current origin
ID to the running dbpick(1) application. This command invokes the
dbpick(1) \fIse\fP command. A carriage-return press in the entry-box
window sends the orid to the dbpick(1) application.

.IP tc
An entry box of this name allows the user to specify the time-correction 
for overlay arrivals (dbpick(1) \fItc\fP command). The initial value 
will be set to the value of the parameter-file variable 
\fIoverlay_time_correction\fP.

.IP ts
An entry box of this name allows the user to specify the start time of
the waveforms to be displayed in dbpick(1). Any string interpretable by
str2epoch(3) may be used. A carriage-return press in the entry-box
window sends the start time to the dbpick(1) application.

.IP tw
An entry box of this name allows the user to specify the length in
seconds of the time window of waveforms to be displayed in dbpick(1). A
carriage-return press in the entry-box window sends the time interval
to the dbpick(1) application.

.SS widget bindings -- frames

.IP stations_frame
If a frame of the name \fIstations_frame\fP appears in the \fIlayout\fP 
table (along with the proper \fIendframe\fP line below it), \fBsmartpick\fP
automatically fills in the frame with a set of buttons for all the sites 
in the site table. Each button selects the waveform for that station. 
As usual, only the channels that correspond to the current
setting of the channels selector will be displayed. 
The stations that are given buttons 
in the \fIstations_frame\fP may be limited to those matching the 
\fIstations_frame_subset\fP parameter in the parameter file (for example, 
a standard approach is to have buttons for only those stations with null 
offdates). The station-buttons are sorted in alphabetical order, 
with each row being filled in from left to right and successive rows 
being filled in as needed. The number of columns is specified with the 
\fIstations_frame_columns\fP parameter of the parameter file. 

.SH OPTIONS
The \fBsmartpick\fP program takes the following command-line options:

.IP "-appname window_name"
This argument is passed to dbpick as the -appname option.

.IP "-comout named_pipe"
This argument is passed to dbpick as the -comout option.

.IP "-dbxcor_appname window_name"
This argument sets the name used to communicate with the dbxcor(1) 
application via the Antelope tksend(1) mechanism.

.IP "-geom dbpick_geometry"
This argument is passed to dbpick as the -geom option. This overrides
the parameter-file \fIdbpick_geometry\fP parameter.

.IP -nostarttalk
This is a synonym for -nowait, implemented for ease of use with
dbloc2.  Note that this -nostarttalk option is slightly different from
that in dbpick: the latter controls whether dbpick brings up its
waveforms immediately or not. The -nostarttalk option for
\fBsmartpick\fP determines whether \fBsmartpick\fP immediately starts
dbpick or not. When \fBsmartpick\fP launches dbpick, dbpick is always
given the -nostarttalk option.

.IP -nowait
This option brings up dbpick automatically upon startup of the 
\fBsmartpick\fP GUI.

.IP "-pf pfname"
This option allows you to specify a parameter file other than the
default \fBsmartpick\fP.pf.

.IP "-winfile winfile"
This argument is passed to dbpick as the -winfile option. If this
option is not specified, the default name "smartpick_dbpick" is used,
or a unique name is generated if that file already exists.

.SH PARAMETER FILE

.SS Explanation of parameter-file parameters

.IP auto_dw
This boolean value determines empty waveforms are automatically deleted
(via the dbpick \fIdw\fP command) after any operation that affects 
which waveforms are shown. 

.IP auto_sw_on
This boolean value determines whether waveforms are automatically turned 
on (via the dbpick \fIsw\fP command) after any operation that affects 
which waveforms are shown. 

.IP autolaunch_dbxcor
If this boolean value is set to a true value, the dbxcor(1) program will 
be launched at the startup of \fBsmartpick\fP. Also, if set, \fBdbpick\fP 
is also automatically started, regardless of any other parameter-file 
or command-line settings. 

.IP balloon_help
This boolean value determines whether balloon help is activated or
not.

.IP channels
The channels array specifies regular expressions for channels to be
displayed in dbpick. Each key in this array gives the name of the
channels selection, e.g. \fIVerticals\fP or \fIAll\fP. Each value gives
the dbpick(1) regular expression to display those channels (in the
style of the dbpick \fIsc\fP command). If the special key of
\fIdbloc2\fP appears in this array (there should be no value
specified), \fBsmartpick\fP attempts to coordinate with a running
instance of dbloc_buttons(1) (i.e.  dbloc2(1) and set the channels as
specified in dbloc2(1).

.IP crunch_on_exit
This table contains the names of database tables on which to perform 
an automatic dbcrunch(1) operation upon regular exit of \fBsmartpick\fP,
which removes any rows set entirely to null by other programs.

.IP dbpick_command_geometry
This parameter specifies the x-window geometry of the dbpick command
window.  If this is left blank, the geometry is left entirely up to the
window manager.

.IP dbpick_command_iconified
This boolean value indicates whether the dbpick command window should
start iconified or not.

.IP dbpick_geometry
This parameter specifies the x-window geometry of the dbpick waveforms
window.  If this is left blank, the geometry is left entirely up to the
window manager.  This parameter-file value is overridden by the
command-line \fI-geom\fP argument if the latter is specified.

.IP dbpick_options
If this is not blank, the contents are passed as additional options to
dbpick (note that options shared by dbpick and by \fBsmartpick\fP, e.g.
appname, comout etc., should be passed directly to \fBsmartpick\fP).

.IP dbprocess_special
This array contains tables of dbprocess commands to generate 
special subsets of origins. These subsets can then be stepped through
sequentially via a series of buttons named \fIfirst_*\fP, 
\fInext_*\fP, \fIprevious_*\fP, \fIlast_*\fP (see the above description
of button widgets for more detail), where the \fI*\fP should be 
replaced by the key used to identify the subset in the \fIdbprocess_special\fP
array. For example, the following parameter file entry would allow you 
to define four buttons  \fIfirst_teleseism\fP, \fInext_teleseism\fP, 
\fIprevious_teleseism\fP, \fIlast_teleseism\fP to step through events further
than 30 degrees from Southern California:

.IP dbxcor_log_file
The output from the dbxcor command is directed to a log file, the name of which 
may be controlled with this \fIdbxcor_log_file\fP parameter. 

.IP required_programs
This table contains the names of programs required by smartpick in order 
to run. Under most conditions, this table should not need to be changed, and 
in fact changes are inadvisable. This is in the parameter-file rather than hard-wired
into code in order to allow operator adjustments for unusual situations.

}

.IP default_postscript_file
This value gives the default name of postscript files to create.

.IP default_snapshot_file
This value gives the default name of screen-snapshot files to create. 
This feature uses the ImageMagick import(1) command. 

.IP groups
The groups array specifies clusters of station-channels to be displayed
in dbpick. Each key in this array gives the name of the group (used
elsewhere to invoke the group); each value gives the list of stations
to display (in the style of a dbpick regular expression for the dbpick
\fIsc\fP command) or a function that can generate the station/channel
list. There are currently two valid function defined. The first is 
\fInet\fP(somenet), which takes the name of a network defined in the
affiliation table of the database. When invoked, this group of stations
is extracted from the database and displayed. The second is 
\fInet\fP(someexpr), which queries dbpick(1) for the current orid, 
finds the corresponding row of the origin table, joins that row to the 
site table, subsets for the specified expression, sorts by distance, 
and displays the results. 

.IP layout
The layout table specifies the presentation of the graphical user
interface for \fBsmartpick\fP.  All buttons etc. may be moved,
restructured, or ommitted as desired, though they should not be renamed
or the bindings to specific actions won't work (in other words, don't
change the second word in the parameter-file line for each widget).
Each line of the layout table should be a widget specification in the
format of the ptkform(3p) utility. See the man page for ptkform(3p) for
more details.

In addition to the ptkform(3p) widgets and frames, \fBsmartpick\fP also
supports the \fInotebook\fP, \fIendnotebook\fP, \fItoplevel\fP, 
and \fIendtoplevel\fP keywords in the
layout table. 

The \fInotebook\fP construct allows widgets (buttons, optionmenus etc.) 
to be put
into a tabbed-notebook style layout.  If these keywords appear, they
should be in a matched pair, i.e. there should be a \fInotebook\fP
entry in the layout table to begin the collection of widgets, and an
\fIendnotebook\fP entry to end the collection:

.in 4c
.ft CW
.nf

.ne 7

layout &Tbl{
notebook
  ...
endnotebook
}

.fi
.ft R
.in

Between these \fInotebook\fP lines, one or more pages may be specified with

.in 4c
.ft CW
.nf
.ne 5

notebook_page pagename
# ...(fill in standard ptkform(3p) widgets
endnotebook_page

.fi
.ft R
.in

Within these lines, one can specify standard ptkform(3p) widgets that
should appear on the particular tabbed page. The \fIpagename\fP word is
used as the label for the page tab.

Similarly, the \fItoplevel\fP construct allows widgets to be put 
into a separate top-level window. If these keywords appear, they
should be in a matched pair, i.e. there should be a \fItoplevel\fP
entry and an \fIendtoplevel\fP entry after all the enclosed widgets 
are listed. An optional X-windows style geometry argument may appear
on the same line as the \fItoplevel\fP specification (only the location
of the toplevel window should be modified, not the size). For example, 
the following layout-table segment will create a stations-selection frame
in a separate window at the bottom left corner of the screen:
.in 4c
.ft CW
.nf
.ne 5

layout &Tbl{
 ...
toplevel +50-50
   frame      stations_frame	-	0,0	Stations 
   endframe
endtoplevel
 ...
}

.fi
.ft R
.in

.IP num_nearby_stations
When an individual station is chosen for display, this parameter 
value specifies the number of nearby stations that are displayed along 
with it. 

.IP overlay_time_correction
This parameter specifies the initial value for overlay time correction
(applied through the dbpick(1) \fItc\fP command).

.IP path
This parameter specifies the unix execution path used to find a 
variety of command-line applications, such as xterm(1), xwininfo(1), 
and dbpick(1). 

.IP print_command
This is the Unix command to which a postscript file can be 
delivered (via standard-input) in order to print to a printer. When 
the \fBsmartpick\fP File->Print menu item is invoked, a dbpick postscript 
file is created and piped to this command. The print command must appear
on the Unix execution path specified in the \fIpath\fP parameter.

.IP shell
This is the absolute path to the shell under which perl system commands
are run. Valid options are absolute paths to tcsh, csh, bash, ksh, or
sh. This is necessary for perl taint checking and may be left as the
default parameter-file &env() specification in most cases.

.IP smartpick_geometry
This parameter controls the geometry of the \fBsmartpick\fP GUI window
itself.  If left blank, the geometry is left entirely to the window
manager.

.IP smartpick_fontsize
This parameter controls the font size of the \fBsmartpick\fP GUI elements.

.IP stations_frame_columns
If a stations_frame widget is defined, this parameter specifies the 
number of columns it will have.

.IP stations_frame_subset
If a stations_frame widget is defined, this parameter specifies the 
subsetting expression to use on the site table of the database in 
choosing stations to display. 

.IP unmap_menubar
This boolean value determines whether the menubar is omitted. The
default is to map the menubar (i.e. \fIunmap_menubar\fP set to 0). For
some applications and geometry layouts, it may be more convenient not
to have the menubar displayed, for example if \fBsmartpick\fP is
controlled entirely from within dbloc2. The disadvantage is that the
File->Quit function won't be available if the menubar is not displayed
(however the \fBsmartpick\fP application can still be killed with a
Cntl-C in the \fBsmartpick\fP GUI window).

.SS Example parameter file
The following shows an example of a fairly extensive \fBsmartpick\fP 
parameter file. For clarity, the optional balloon-help phrases are 
left out of the widget-specification lines.

.SS Within dbloc2
The following entry in the \fIProcesses\fP table of the dbloc2(1)
parameter-file launches dbpick(1) for dbloc2(1) under the control of
\fBsmartpick\fP. Note that this is identical to the dbpick(1)
launch-line in the default dbloc2.pf parameter file, with the name of
the dbpick executable replaced by the name \fBsmartpick\fP:

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"

The dbpick commands filter, tmadd, tmdel have not been implemented 
in \fBsmartpick\fP. The \fIsave\fP (trexcerpt(1)) feature of smartpick
has not been implemented. 
It should be possible to add a mechanism to group stations by
geographic coordinates. However, this has not yet been implemented.
There may be some ondate issues in the choice of stations for a given
network (offdate is currently ignored).

In principle it would be possible to have several different layout
templates sketched out in the parameter file for easy switching.  This
has been deliberately avoided in the current version to keep the
parameter file from getting too complex.

The \fIcw\fP text-box implementation is more simplistic than the previous 
hop-up and hop-down buttons with associated sliders for number of stations 
to display and starting trace number. It's not clear whether this is a
limitation or an improvement. 

The \fIlayout\fP table of the parameter-file does not tolerate blank
lines (If a comment is interspersed, it should start with a hash sign
as the very first character of the line).

All command-line options must be specified before the name(s) of the
database(s) are given.

With judicious use of the \fIdbname\fP and \fIstart_dbpick\fP widgets,
\fBsmartpick\fP can actually manage multiple instances of dbpick. This
may be useful in some situations. However, this capability has not been
formalized to make it completely smooth. The user may have to learn
about and use the unregister(1) command, for example, and make sure
they understand in principle the underlying tksend(1) mechanism for
communication amongst \fBsmartpick\fP, dbpick(1), and dbloc2(1).

The network and affiliation tables are read only at startup, thus
stations or networks added after \fBsmartpick\fP has been launched will
not be detected. Furthermore, networks which do not have any stations 
associated with them in the affiliation table will be ignored by 
\fBsmartpick\fP.

The feature to show stations with nearby stations bases its calculation
on the first entry of a given name in the site table. If that row 
is closed with a non-null offdate and the station has since moved, the 
calculation will be only approximate. It is hard to second-guess the 
appropriate behavior here for a tool that will be used on both 
current and historical data. Additionally, if the \fInum_nearby_stations\fP
parameter is nonzero and a station is selected that has no data, 
the nearby stations may be shown but the actual station selected 
will be omitted. This is not an error; this is \fBsmartpick\fP
and dbpick's best attempt to do what the user asked when not all
the necessary information is available. 

\fBsmartpick\fP is a way to send commands to dbpick. It is not intended
to be a faithful mirror of the internal state of dbpick at any given
time. As one example, the optionmenu widgets in \fBsmartpick\fP can get
out of synch with the dbpick(1) display if changes are made to
dbpick(1) directly through the command line interface or through
dbloc2(1). This is essentially harmless and can by resynchronized
simply by choosing another option in the relevant \fBsmartpick\fP
optionmenu.

The qwm tools that allowed the waveforms to be summoned from smartpick
in the old version appear not to be supported in Perl Tk. Thus the
"Summon Waveforms" and "Summon Command Prompt" buttons are not
present.  It may be possible to rectify this if necessary.

It is probably best to use the smartpick_geometry parameter to set only
the position of the \fBsmartpick\fP GUI window, and let the size and
aspect ratio be set by the window manager (according to the widget
layout given in the parameter file).

The PATH value from the unix environment is not used due to Perl::Tk
security restrictions imposed by the communication mechanism between 
dbpick(1) and \fBsmartpick\fP. The Unix path must be specified in 
the \fBsmartpick\fP parameter file instead. The default value of this 
parameter should be usable for most standard installations. 

Note that the \fIdbloc2\fP entry in the \fIchannels\fP array of the
parameter file will only work for dbloc2 channel selections that
contain a simple dbpick regular expression.

The \fInext_*\fP, \fInext_*\fP,\fInext_*\fP,\fInext_*\fP series 
of buttons calculate their position in a sequence of origins that 
is loaded once the first time used, is not updated, and ignores any other 
positioning commands in smartpick / dbpick (i.e. if you hit \fIfirst_teleseism\fP, 
then \fInext_teleseism\fP a couple times, regardless of all the other event selection
or time-scrolling commands you do the next time you hit \fInext_teleseism\fP
you'll get the fourth one in the sequence). 

In order to allow tksend messages between smartpick, dbpick, and dbloc2
via Perl::Tk, \fBsmartpick\fP is written in taint-checked Perl.  This
means all inputs and values from the database are validated against
internal regular expressions.  It is conceivable that some valid cases
have been omitted from these expressions, in which case \fBsmartpick\fP
will complain and may require slight modification.

The Snapshot feature relies on the ImageMagick import(1) command, 
and will be disabled if that command is not found on the execution 
path (as specified by the parameter-file value \fIpath\fP). 

The print and pipe-to-postscript menu items launch unsupervised
unix tasks in the background. If these fail, the user may not be 
notified in any easily visible way (complaints and messages go to the 
standard output of the \fBsmartpick\fP executable itself, but this 
may be buried in dbloc2(1) log files). 

With so much geometry control left to the user and to the ptkform(3p)
module, it is common to get layouts with odd blank space. There's no
escaping the need for time spent on careful layout design. It is 
possible to make quite a mess. 

If there's no waveform data for a station, choosing the button for that 
station may not produce a sensible response (it may make the dbpick screen
blank, or leave the previous display untouched). 

As of Antelope 4.11, the dbpick 'sas off' and 'sas on' commands, and therefore
their associated smartpick buttons, work if and only if the -showassocs 
flag is given on the dbpick command line (i.e. included in the \fIdbpick_options\fP
parameter in the \fBsmartpick\fP.pf parameter file).

In principle it would be nice to make this work with tkdbpick as well.
